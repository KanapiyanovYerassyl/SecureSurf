## How to Load in Chrome (Development)

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select the `phishguard/` folder
5. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

##  API Key Setup (Optional but recommended)

The extension works **without an API key** using heuristics only.

To enable **Google Safe Browsing** (more accurate):

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the **Safe Browsing API**
3. Create an API key
4. In `src/background.js`, replace:
   ```js
   const GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY";
   ```
   with your actual key.

##  How It Works

### Heuristic Detection
Analyzes URLs for:
- Raw IP addresses instead of domains
- Suspicious TLDs (`.xyz`, `.tk`, `.ml`, etc.)
- Brand impersonation in subdomains (e.g. `paypal.evil.com`)
- Excessive subdomain depth
- Hyphenated domains
- HTTP (non-HTTPS) connections
- URL shorteners
- Suspicious keywords (`verify`, `login`, `confirm`, etc.)
- `@` symbol in URLs
- Phishing phrases in page text (`"verify your identity"`, etc.)

### Google Safe Browsing API
Cross-checks URLs against Google's database of known phishing/malware URLs.

##  Risk Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 SAFE | No signals detected |
| 🔵 LOW | Minor signals, probably fine |
| 🟡 CAUTION | Suspicious content, be careful |
| 🔴 DANGER | High confidence phishing attempt |

## Testing Phishing Detection

Use safe test resources:
- **PhishTank** (phishtank.com) – database of known phishing URLs
- **Google Safe Browsing Test** – `testsafebrowsing.appspot.com`
- Try URLs like: `http://paypal-secure-login.tk/verify`
